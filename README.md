# Introducing Valet

Valet is a fast, efficient and user-friendly hospitality management system that streamlines the operations of hospitality venues. 
The Android and web-based applications combine to allow easy management of reservations, allocation of tables, menu management and ordering. Valet also integrates with the venue's existing website, allowing customers to make reservations online and ensures that all reservation information is easily accessible for venue staff. 
With Valet, running a hospitality venue becomes a breeze – whatever’s on the menu - allowing you to focus on providing excellent service to your customers.


# Valet Android App

The Valet Android app is specifically designed to streamline the operations of hospitality venues on the go.

* Upon launch, staff are presented with the Dashboard with widgets that give staff a snapshot of the day, including information occupancy, reservations and orders.
* Built from the ground up for speed and efficiency, with a UI that brings functionality to the forefront. 
* Built using Flutter, making it a reliable and user-friendly tool for managing your venue's operations on the go, and providing the ability to easily extend to iOS, Mac or Windows apps in the future with the same codebase.
